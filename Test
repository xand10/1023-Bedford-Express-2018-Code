2.   Describe the character/person who changed the most from beginning of the book to the end of the book. Explain the change and what caused it (use back side if necessary). Be thorough and use evidence from the text to support what you say.
The person who changed the most from the beginning of the book to the end of the book was Anja, she started off as a ditzy rich girl who simply had a bunch of money and a lot of free time. Anja was also the only main character in the story which gets affected by bluescreen, the drug with the side effect of letting someone else control one’s body. Throughout the story, Anja is seen as somewhere in between the girl that people hang around for her money and a tinkering genius. As the story progresses, Anja continually becomes more tech genius and less ditzy rich girl. This change is caused by a severe trauma which leads to her realizing that she must help her friends to find out what is going on. In the story, Anja ends up being taken over by the Bluescreen drug and sleep walking into the freeway, “After we left the club Anja wasn’t just sleepwalking; she was sleepjumping in front of semis on the freeway,” (Wells 96), This experience changes Anja from the ditzy rich kid which she normally is into a very driven, very focused individual trying to figure out what went wrong. This change facilitates the plot to move forward as she uses her tech prowess to help solve the mystery of the Bluescreen drug.
3. Describe a minor character/person in the book who had major importance. Explain. Be thorough and use evidence from the text to support what you say.
A minor character in this book who had major importance was eLiza; eLiza was the original coder of the Bluescreen drug. eLiza was a college student learning about programming, she contacted someone on the dark web to learn more about the Dolly Girls program, a program which allows the user to be controlled by someone else like wearing their body. She coded this program into a digital drug which got widely circulated. It was eLiza’s death which alerted the protagonists of the connection with the drug Bluescreen and mind control, “eLiza was getting too close, poking around where she didn’t belong, and the dealers — whoever they are — used their puppet program...they controlled their bodies remotely, and they used them to kill a girl,” (Wells 148). eLiza ends up being murdered by a person hacking into the program and using other people’s bodies to commit the crime as a way to tie up loose ends. This revelation leads the group down a long path to find out who it is that is behind the Bluescreen drug.
5. Above you rated this book. Explain in detail why you gave this book that score (use back side if necessary). Be thorough and use evidence from the text to support what you say.
I rated this book 9 stars; I gave Bluescreen this rating because of a few reasons. First off, the book was very well written and it captured my attention quite successfully. The book never had a dull moment, making sure that the reader was always kept in suspense or in deep action to ensure their attention never left it.Another reason I gave this book a 9 star rating was it’s use of spanish; this book featured LA roughly 20 years in the future, after it has surpassed connecticut in landmass and exceeded the US border. The small attention to detail of having the characters throw in spanish words and insults as if they are speaking a medley of English and Spanish ensured that the reader felt the nature of the book. This detail showed that the author cared enough to spend the time to correctly translate sections of the book into Spanish, properly doing his research on the way. I did not give this book a 10 star rating because it had a relatively predictable plot line at certain points; however, overall Bluescreen was very well written and deserves a 9 star rating.
6. Evaluate the ending of the book. Considering how the book unfolded, is it an effective ending? Why or why not? Be thorough and use evidence from the text to support what you say.
I would definitely consider the ending to Bluescreen very effective. The book ends with the main characters in the hospital after the Bluescreen attack, they are visiting their friend who was affected. This ties up almost all of the loose ends which were in the story: such as who the mastermind behind the research and development of the Bluescreen drug was, as well as the fate of those affected. However Wells purposefully added to a loose end instead of tying it up in the form of Grendel taking over the body of La Princesa and talking to Marissa, “Who else knew about Bluescreen? Who else had talked to her, had given her information, had guided her along some path she’d thought she’d been choosing on her own–-The answer struck her like a thunderbolt. Grendel,” (Wells 333). This conversation adds more questions to the story than it does answers, leaving readers wishing for a sequel, and giving them a reason to come back. By adding in a touch more information right at the end of the story, Wells made sure that readers would want to continue reading, and in the absence of any more information, they would wait to read the next book.
7. If this book had gone one more chapter, what would have happened? Explain (use back side if necessary). Be thorough and use evidence from the text to support what you say.
An additional chapter is not necessary; however, If this book had gone one more chapter it would have been the aftermath and cleanup of the Bluescreen outbreak in La Sesenta. The story leaves the world in a disheveled state, just before any cleanup happened after the major shooting and gang war which occurred due to the Bluescreen drug. “Even with most of the Bluescreen victims shuttled off to other hospitals, the Mirador facility was ground zero for the worst of the worst cases,” (Wells, 324). The book ends with Marisa alone in the hospital just about to head home to begin the cleanup from the attack. This extra chapter would have given a touch more closure to the book, instead of leaving it as a cliffhanger. This ending would have allowed the reader to process the previous chapters whilst they finished off the wrap-up chapter.
